# REVAMP-PROMPTS.md
### The prompts for the revamp sessions — paste one, get one route

The revamp is deliberately many small sessions, not one large one. Each session
takes **one route**, rebuilds it, proves it, **rewrites §1 of this file for the
next session**, and stops. §1 is therefore always the prompt to paste next — it
is updated by the session before yours, not by hand. That is the whole
method, and it exists because the alternative already happened: R3 reached 41
boxes with `design/templates/` empty, and a clipped action column and unstyled
purple links both reached production unseen.

**Order:** every console route (`CONSOLE-REVAMP.md` §3) → **the student app
REMADE as a game, in `WEB-REMAKE.md` §8's order** (the look system, the shell,
then every route; ruled 30 Sep 2026, superseding `WEB-REVAMP.md` §6's order) →
moons for planets 00–04 (R4) → the act-1 minigames. Each minigame is a page like
any other: one session, one gate.

**Milestone: the first release is act 1 — stages 00–04 and the Prelim — as the
full experience.** Rebuilt pages, planet zoom, real orbits, moons and the act-1
minigames, so students use the finished product while 05–18 are built. §4 has
the scope, what exists today (very little), and the two blockers that are not
design work at all.

---

## 1. Start here — the next session: the act-1 encounters, on their moons (R4.5)

*Rewritten 30 Sep 2026 (late night) by the session that built moons opening
planets end to end (`objective_progress`, the moon's journey, per-moon mastery,
moons and a moon panel on the map, Orientation's asteroids, and
`is_stage_unlocked()` reading moons). Phase at handover: **R3 71 / 86**,
**R4 16 / 30**; all tracks **172 done · 53 to-do (225 items, 76%)**.
`pnpm phase` is the count, not this line. The prompt is in a plain block so it
pastes exactly as written.*

```text
Read docs/NEXT-SESSION.md section 0w first (what the moons build found and
parked), then docs/redesign/WEB-REVAMP.md 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7a (3.7a is DECIDED
and BUILT), docs/redesign/phases/R4-*.md (R4.5 and R4.6),
docs/redesign/MINIGAME-PROPOSALS.md, docs/GAME-DESIGN.md section 10 (Phaser: lazy,
per route, never in the initial bundle), and design/templates/web/moon-journey/
SPEC.md (the journey a minigame will dress). Root CLAUDE.md hard rules 4, 5
and 9 bind. Do not re-derive what those carry.

Run pnpm phase. Show the table, say the percentage, name the live phase. Then
state plainly whether Prelim-worth of data is okay to run on students, checking
the five conditions in CLAUDE.md rather than remembering them. (On 30 Sep it
was NOT: locally all 96 act-1 items were at review and 0 live, so no paper
fills and, since moons now open planets and a moon with no live question holds
its planet shut, stage 02 is shut for any real student; the deployment was last
measured 28 Sep with no act-1 content or items and has none of attempt_events,
objective_progress, the journeys or the moon rule.)

Confirm everything is green before touching anything, AGAINST BUILDS. First
kill every orphaned API tree (NEXT-SESSION 0w.5: every node process whose
command line has scripts/dev-api.mjs, with taskkill /T /F, then confirm
nothing listens on 8090). Then pnpm db:reset, then node scripts/db-demo.mjs
(read its whole output: 702 moons mastered for the demo cohort), start ONE
pnpm dev:api and prove it with a real GET, build apps/web and preview it on
5185, build apps/console and preview it on 5186 (npx vite preview --port 5186
--strictPort in apps/console). Then the web suite (every design/specs file
except console-*, plus console-locks: 628 tests, 505 passed, 123 skipped, 0
failed on 30 Sep late night), the console suite (814: 756 passed, 58 skipped)
and pnpm test (716 API tests). Never reset while a Playwright suite runs; after
the API suite run db:reset THEN db-demo; never edit services/api/src while a
suite runs against it.

Then ask the instructor, in one go: (1) approve the minigame placements in
WEB-REVAMP 3.6 (01.2 Sort, 02.8 Drill, 03.9 Bus wiring, 04.5 Cache drill), or
change them; (2) The Descent: first release or Midterm; (3) NEXT-SESSION 0w.1:
does the student record on the console show each student's moon mastery;
(4) R4.6's last box (the biome as the sidebar's background) predates ruling 2's
one star HUD: superseded, or wanted; (5) push tonight's schema to the
deployment now (it needs the section 3b --reset). Record every answer where it
belongs (3.6, R4.5, R4.6, 0w) before building on it.

The work, once 3.6 is approved, one encounter at a time, each through the page
gate (template captured as an artifact, SPEC.md, a spec green on all six
assertions at 1440 and 380, captures opened), committed and pushed before the
next: first the Stage 01 Sort on moon 01.2, in DOM, inside that moon's
journey. A minigame dresses practice and NEVER an assessment (data-encounter
never wraps the runner of a check or an exam); it is never the only path
through a moon (the journey's questions still count without it); it grades
nothing on the client (hard rule: no client-side scoring); its content comes
from docs/source or the database, never invented (hard rule 5). Then Drill on
02.8, then Cache drill on 04.5, then Bus wiring on 03.9 (Phaser, lazy, with a
keyboard path and a non-canvas fallback, and dist/index.html grepped for no
Phaser preload).

End: pnpm phase with the percentage, the Prelim sentence checked, docs/
NEXT-SESSION.md and PROGRESS.md updated, this section rewritten for the
session after, committed and pushed, and the next prompt given in one plain
fenced block.
```

## 2. Continue — every session after the first

> Continue the revamp per `docs/redesign/CONSOLE-REVAMP.md` (then
> `WEB-REVAMP.md` once the console is finished).
>
> Start with `pnpm phase` — table, percentage, live phase — and the
> Prelim-readiness sentence.
>
> **Confirm the previous route's spec is still green before touching anything.**
> If it is red, that is this session's work and the next route waits.
>
> Then take the next route in order and do the same six steps: capture and
> **verify** the reference first (open the file and look at it — a 200 and a
> saved PNG prove a file exists, not that it shows what you needed), write
> `SPEC.md`, write the spec and watch it fail, rebuild — replacing entirely if
> that is the right answer — then capture `current.png` and `current-380.png`
> and **open both and look at them**, then write `motion.md`.
>
> **Check `design/specs/` before writing a spec.** 18 already exist. If the route
> has one, EXTEND it — the REDO rule licenses replacing the *page*, never the
> proof that it works.
>
> Toasts, loading states and transitions are required, not optional.
>
> **THIS SESSION IS ONLY FOR THAT ONE ROUTE.** Defects found elsewhere go into
> `docs/NEXT-SESSION.md`, not into this session's diff.
>
> One route. Screenshots, spec output, assertions run versus assumed. Tick the
> box in the same commit. Commit and push.
>
> **Then rewrite §1 of this file for the session after you** — the next route,
> what you learned, updated phase figures — and commit and push that. Stop.
>
> If a route needs a decision that is the instructor's — a lock policy, what a
> control should do, anything that changes what a student sees — stop and ask
> rather than choosing.

## 3. The rules that bind every one of these sessions

**And not only these sessions.** Root `CLAUDE.md` says it plainly: the revamp is
the first application of these rules, not their scope. A **new page** is born
with a template, a `SPEC.md` and a spec, and does not merge until that spec is
green. **Changing an existing page** carries the same gate on the page you
touched. If the page has no spec yet, you are the session that gives it one.

The only exemption is a change that alters no structure, layout, control or
state — copy, a typo, a comment, data. Even then the route's existing spec must
be **green** and you must say you ran it.

Every one of these applies to **all pages already built**, not only to routes
in a revamp list — a new page, a page being changed, and a page being rebuilt
are all governed the same way.

None of the following is negotiable, and the first outranks the rest:

- **SCREENSHOT IT WITH PLAYWRIGHT, THEN OPEN IT AND LOOK.** Every page, every
  iteration, 1440 and 380. A green spec is not seeing — a passing assertion and
  an exit code of 0 are claims about a process, not evidence about a picture.
  Read the image back. It is the rule that caught the clipped action column, the
  ordering items rendered as radio buttons, the purple links, and an icon that
  wrote successfully and rendered as a broken-image glyph.

- **ONE SESSION, ONE ROUTE — AND IT HANDS OVER.** A session does exactly the
  route its prompt names. It ends by rewriting §1 of this file for the next
  session, committed and pushed. The prompt is the handoff; a chat transcript
  is not.
- **END WITH THE PROMPT, READY TO PASTE.** The session's closing message ends
  with the new §1 prompt in one fenced code block, as plain text with no `> `
  quote markers, so the user can copy it in one go. The full text, not a link
  and not a summary. Instructor ruling, 25 Sep 2026; root `CLAUDE.md` makes it
  a rule for every session, not only these.
- **NEVER PROCEED TO ANOTHER PAGE IF THIS ONE HAS NOT PASSED.** Green on all six
  assertions at both widths. Not "mostly". If a route cannot pass, that route is
  the work — say what is blocking it and stop.
- **REDO THE PAGE, DO NOT IMPROVE IT.** The old page is a requirements document.
- **YOU MAY REPLACE A PAGE ENTIRELY.** Different layout, different structure,
  different interaction. Bound only by `packages/tokens`, the three themes at
  AA, keyboard-only operation, 380px without horizontal scroll, the eight hard
  rules, and the data and controls the route owes its user. No permission needed
  to throw a page away.
- **Templates are artifacts, never links.** Capture, then open it and look.
- **Commit and push when context management kicks in.** Not commit — push. Both
  hosts build from `main`.
- **Audit the page against its spec before touching it.** Read its
  `PAGE-SPECS.md` row. A planned feature that is missing, or a planned page that
  does not exist, gets named, planned, given a captured template, and **brought
  to the instructor for approval** — never built unasked, never skipped
  silently. 42 routes are specified, 27 are built, and the console ones are
  written with a `/console/` prefix the app does not use — reconcile names
  before calling anything missing.
- **Every phase report is a table and carries the percentage.**
- **Toasts, loading states, transitions** — `.claude/rules/design.md`, on every
  page you create or change, not only revamped ones.

And the standing ones: screenshot before believing a page works; denial test
first for anything touching data; check the stack is alive and is the right app
before believing a red run; `pnpm verify` empties the seeded database, so reseed
before measuring.

## 4. The first release — the Prelim, as the full experience

**Decision, 25 Sep 2026 (instructor):** the first release is not a bare exam
with a map attached. It is **act 1, stages 00–04, playable as the finished
product** — so students get the real OCTA while stages 05–18 are still being
built. Everything a student can touch in act 1 works the way the whole course
eventually will.

### In the first release

| | Scope | State, measured 25 Sep |
|---|---|---|
| **Console** | every route the instructor needs to run act 1, `/items` first | **every route through the gate**, 29 Sep 2026 (`/items` first on 25 Sep, `/attempts/:attemptId` last) |
| **Student routes** | the attempt runner, the stage reader, both maps, `/app/work`, login | rebuild pending (`WEB-REVAMP.md` §6) |
| **Planet selection, sidebar, ENTER JOURNEY** | select a planet → zoom → sidebar with a tiny summary and the objectives, over the planet's biome → ENTER JOURNEY → content over the same biome. The map canvas never carries a biome | not built (`WEB-REVAMP.md` §3) |
| **Planet summaries** | a tiny summary and the objectives, in the sidebar | **19 drafted, 0 approved**: live only once the instructor approves each |
| **Keplerian orbits** | the whole map, `ω ∝ a^-1.5` | not built (`WEB-REVAMP.md` §4) |
| **Moons** | **planets 01–04**: one per objective; each moon's journey is its own practice plus its minigame; **moons unlock the next planet** | R4; two decisions open (`WEB-REVAMP.md` §3.7) |
| **Minigames** | **the act-1 encounters, each living in the moon it teaches** (`WEB-REVAMP.md` §3.6) | **none exist** |
| **Toasts, loading, transitions** | every route above | on `/items` only; the toast component is shared from `apps/console` |
| **Icon** | both apps | done |

**The act-1 encounters** — `GAME-DESIGN.md` §10.3's table, keyed to the real
curriculum:

| Stage | Encounter | Built with |
|---|---|---|
| 01 · Introduction | Sort — classification | DOM |
| 02 · Computer Evolution and Performance | Drill — computed answer | DOM |
| 03 · Top Level View and Interconnection | Bus wiring — the shared bus visibly constricting is the lesson | **Phaser** |
| 04 · Cache Memory | Cache drill — `<input type=range>`, keyboard-accessible for free | DOM |
| after 04 | **The Descent** — memory-hierarchy platformer, unlocked on completing 04, paid off at 06 | **Phaser** |

**Measured: zero of these exist.** `apps/web/src/lib/encounters.ts` maps panel
*themes* to stages — skins, not games. Phaser is not installed. The "existing
Cache Tuner" `MINIGAME-PROPOSALS.md` refers to is not in the source. Every row is
new work.

Rules that bind them, from `GAME-DESIGN.md` §10 and root `CLAUDE.md`: Phaser is
**lazy-loaded per route and never in the initial bundle** (it is ~1 MB, four
times the entire 3D budget); a canvas encounter has no accessibility semantics,
so every Phaser game carries a keyboard path and a non-canvas fallback;
encounters dress the LAB beat and **never an assessment**; and they are pages
like any other — template, `SPEC.md`, spec, screenshot, gate.

**The Descent spans 04→06**, so its payoff lands in Midterm content. Stages 05
and 06 are authored, so it can be built — but whether it ships in the first
release or waits for the Midterm is **the instructor's call**. Ask before
building it.

### Not in the first release

Stages 05–18 as playable content, the Semi-final and Finals exams, the
remaining four approved minigames (Hazard Interceptor 14, Fault Line 18, Amdahl
500 17, Mnemonic Sprint 10→11), `/console/analytics`. Their planets still render
on the map — in orbit, correctly placed, honestly locked — so the map is whole
even where the course is not yet.

### Not design work, and still blocking — say this every session

1. **0 of 183 items are `live`.** The engine samples `where status = 'live'`, so
   every attempt fails to fill at Start. Act 1's 96 items must be approved,
   through `/items` — which is why `/items` goes first.
2. ~~**Stage 00 gates stage 01.**~~ **BUILT 30 Sep 2026.** The instructor ruled
   on 25 Sep 2026 that **a non-gradeable prerequisite never blocks**;
   `is_stage_unlocked()` now counts only gradeable prerequisites and the API's
   `lockReason` names only those, so stage 01 is open from the start. Locally
   only until the schema is pushed to the deployment.

### Order

`/items` → approve act 1 → decide stage 00 → the rest of the console →
attempt runner → stage reader → flat map → **the remake (`WEB-REMAKE.md` §8:
the look system → the shell → 3D map with zoom and orbits → every route again)** →
**moons for 00–04** → **act-1 encounters, one per session like any page** →
`/app/work`, login → **ship act 1** → then 05–18.

Moons land with the zoom, never before it — moons on a map nobody can zoom into
are decoration.
